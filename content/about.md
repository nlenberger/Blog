I am a student currently enrolled at Georgetown College. My main area of interest is Biochemistry. I plan to attend Medical School after earning my degree here at Georgetown. However, I am also interested in scientific research which is what lead me to computer programming. I enjoy learning the intricate language of R and am intrigued by the ways it allows me to analyze and present my data.  
On my blog you will find posts ranging from lab reports, experimental data analysis, to CSC HW help.
