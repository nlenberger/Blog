      <description>Introduction In this lab, two types of differential staining were performed. The first was Gram staining and the second was Acid Fast. Gram staining is one of the most commonly used staining procedures used in microbiology. Gram staining can characterize bacteria into two groups: gram positive bacteria or gram negative bacteria. Gram postive bacteria stain violet while gram negative bacteria stain red. This is due to the peptidoglycan layers in the bacteria; a thicker layer allows for the retention of the stain.</description>
