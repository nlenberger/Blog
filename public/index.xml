      <description>Introduction In this lab, two types of differential staining were performed. The first was Gram staining and the second was Acid Fast. Gram staining is one of the most commonly used staining procedures in microbiology. Gram staining can characterize bacteria into two groups: gram positive bacteria or gram negative bacteria. Gram positive bacteria stain violet while gram negative bacteria stain red. This is due to the peptidoglycan layers in the bacteria; a thicker layer allows for the retention of the stain.</description>

      <description>Before beginning this assignment we must first take care of a couple housekeeping things in R.
First you must load the package TurtleGraphics
library(TurtleGraphics) Exercise 1 The Problem Using the TurtleGraphics funciton write a function called ‘turtle_gon()’ that draws a regular polygon. The user should be able to specifiy the side-length and the number of sides. Usig your function draw a polygon with 12 sides, each having a length of 15 units.</description>

      <description>I am a student currently enrolled at Georgetown College. My main area of interest is Biochemistry. I plan to attend Medical School after earning my degree here at Georgetown. However, I am also interested in scientific research which is what lead me to computer programming. I enjoy learning the intricate language of R and am intrigued by the ways it allows me to analyze and present my data.
On my blog you will find posts ranging from lab reports, experimental data analysis, to CSC HW help.</description>
